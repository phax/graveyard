EDIFACT to XML conversion
=========================

Very simplistic EDIFACT parser enabling easy transformation of the EDIFACT structure to XML.

Usage:

	java -jar edifact-to-xml.jar edifact-file
       
Features are kept at a minimum since the main intent of the transformation is to do further 
processing using XSLT.
